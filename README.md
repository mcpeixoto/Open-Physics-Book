# Open Physics Book

## &gt; [BOOK LINK](https://app.gitbook.com/@miguelpeixoto457/s/open-physics-book/) &lt;

## Who is this book for?

The **Open Physics Book** is a **free, online,** and **collaborative** book that will teach you all the things you possibly want or need about physics in an appealing format borrowed from software developers. The topics range from the math fundamentals to quantum mechanics, passing by classical mechanics and other neat topics with a pinch of engineering.

If you are a student, a teacher, a researcher, or even someone that is just curious about physics and how the universe works this book is for you. You can either learn from it or add content that it doesn't have yet.

This is intended to be a forever expanding and broad book, explaining in detail each topic. Each chapter and subchapter shall have, apart from the content itself, additional resources such as videos, animations, and references useful to you, the learner.

Happy reading and learning!

## How to contribute?

Want to help the community? Neat!

Before you start, it's recommended you learn about **Git** and **GitHub** - You can find a short youtube playlist for these topics [**here**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY&list=PLozRqGzj97d02YjR5JVqDwN2K0cAiT7VK%29) \(watch until the 3Âº video at least\).

Even though you haven't watched the playlist is fine, we will try our best to make a comprehensive guide on how you can contribute ðŸ™‚.

**1Âº** Access our main GitHub repository by clicking [here](https://github.com/mcpeixoto/Open-Physics-Book)**.**  
**2Âº** Assuming that you already have and logged in to your GitHub account, click on "**Fork**" on the top right of the page - This will make a copy of the main repository to your account so that you can play around freely without breaking anything.  
**3Âº** Now that you have a copy of the book on your account, it's time to start editing! For making the process of adding content easier we use GitBook. Please log in to the platform using your GitHub account [here](https://app.gitbook.com/).  
**4Âº** You now should see the GitBook homepage. We're going to create a new space by clicking "**Create a new space**" on the top left corner, you can name it whatever you want and then press "**Create**".  
**5Âº** Go to "**Integrations**" and activate **Github**. Click on "**List only public repositories**" and click on the one you forked \(your\_user/Open-Physics-Book\). Hit **"Next**" until it loads the repository to your text editor.  
**6Âº** Finally you can \(really\) start editing! Add pages, write whole paragraphs or edit them. Click "Save" each time you change something. After you finished your editing spree just merge all the edits by hitting "Merge" and all the changes should be automatically committed to your forked GitHub repository.  
**7Âº** If you access your forked GitHub repository you can see that there's a new button, "**Create a Pull Request**". Click it, add a title and a comment about your contribution and hit **submit**. You've just contributed to the book! A moderator will review your contribution and if everything checks out it will be added to the book as fast as possible. You just made thLink: [https://app.gitbook.com/@miguelpeixoto457/s/open-physics-book/](https://app.gitbook.com/@miguelpeixoto457/s/open-physics-book/)e world a better place ðŸ˜ƒ
